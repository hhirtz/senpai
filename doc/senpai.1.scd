# NAME

senpai - your everyday IRC student

# SYNOPSIS

*senpai* [options...]

# OPTIONS

*-config* <path>
	Use a different path for the configuration file.

*-debug*
	Show all IRC messages that are received from/sent to the server.

# DESCRIPTION

senpai is an IRC client made for bouncers.  It supports the newest IRC
extensions, such as:

- _CHATHISTORY_, senpai fetches history from the server instead of keeping logs,
- _@+typing_, senpai shows when others are typing a message,
- _BOUNCER_, senpai connects to all your networks at once automatically,
- and more to come!

# CONFIGURATION

senpai needs a configuration file to start.  It searches for it in the following
location:

	$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/senpai/senpai.scfg

If unset, $XDG_CONFIG_HOME defaults to *~/.config*.

For information about the configuration format, see *senpai*(5).

# USER INTERFACE

The user interface of senpai consists of 4 parts.  Starting from the bottom:

The *buffer list*, shows joined channels.  The special buffer *home* is where
private messages and server notices are shown.  This list can be put on the left
of the screen with the _chan-column-width_ configuration option.

On the row above, the *input field* is where you type in messages or commands
(see *COMMANDS*).  By default, when you type a message, senpai will inform
others in the channel that you are typing.

On the row above, the *status line* (or... just a line if nothing is
happening...) is where typing indicators are shown (e.g. "dan- is typing...").

Finally, the *timeline* is displayed on the rest of the screen.  Several types
of messages are in the timeline:

- User messages are shown with their nicknames,
- User actions (*/me*) are shown with an asterisk (*\**) followed by the user's
  nickname,
- Status messages, such as joins, parts, topics and name lists, are shown with
  two dashes (*--*),
- Notices are shown with an asterisk (*\**) followed by the user nickname and a
  colon
